PROBLEM STATEMENT :- A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
  
  
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
  
  SOLUTION :-
    class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& num) 
    {
       int low = 0, high = num.size() - 1;
        while (low < high - 1) 
        {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            
            if (num[mid] > num[mid - 1] && num[mid] > num[mid + 1]) 
                return mid;
            
            else if (num[mid] > num[mid + 1]) 
                    high = mid - 1;
            
            else 
                    low = mid + 1;    
        }
        return num[low] > num[high] ? low : high;
    }
};
